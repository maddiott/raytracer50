# raytracer50
Repository for CS50 Final Project a Ray Tracer

# Dependencies
GLFW (A cross platform OpenGl wrapper)
Dear imGui (A cross platform imediate mode gui toolkit)
- included in this repo under OutsideLibs
Probably something like minibmp

# Assets
Mesh of the Utah Teapot

# Goals for This Program
- Create a basic raytracer (naive intersection of polynomials with Lambertian shading)
- No textures because meh
- Embed the thing in a gui
- Support reading in arbitrary meshes
- Render and show progress (speed is optional, so no BVHs) with button
- Set resolution and samples per pixel (uniform sampling)
- Save image as file that can be opened in windows photo viewer
    probably a bmp since those are easy
- Use CMake
- Explore object oriented c++
